BigInteger
==========

An Implementation of BigInteger library in C++

This Project contains two versions of the library:

1. Library split into .h and .cpp file. 
   Detailed Description of library functions present in .h file.
   For use in projects when no boundation on number of file or size.

   Files: BigInteger.h, BigInteger.cpp


2. Entire Library in single file.
   I removed the comments and put the code in Java indentation style
   to decrease size and space.
   For use in Programming Contests or places when one single file code
   is required.

   File: BigIntegerSingleFile.cpp
